Project Overview

-Our project aims to explore the potential of Bitcoin as a sustainable and practical form of currency in our ever-evolving world. To do this, we will delve into the historical performance and characteristics of Gold, Silver, and Bitcoin. By comparing these three forms of currency, we intend to gain insights into whether Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency, has the potential to become a stable and useful medium of exchange.

Research Questions

To guide our exploration, we have framed several research questions:

Which is more stable, Gold, Bitcoin, or Silver? 

- We will analyze the historical price data to determine the stability of these assets.

Was there a shift in market sentiment when Bitcoin was created? Did it divert attention from Gold and Silver, with expectations of a digital currency future? - We will investigate market sentiment changes and shifts in investments before and after the emergence of Bitcoin.

Which countries hold the most reserves of Gold? 

- We will use a heatmap to visualize the distribution of Gold reserves around the world.

Data Presentation

To start, we will present a basic layout for our project website, providing a quick overview of what visitors will find on our page. We invite them to participate in voting for their preferred asset if they were to invest. We kindly ask visitors to vote only once.

Which Asset is More Stable?

Bitcoin does not have a very long history, and judging from the charts that go back almost 10 years, it's clear that while Bitcoin has a higher monetary value than Gold, it is far more volatile over this 10-year period. Gold and Silver both have what appear to be very predictable volume patterns and slow but steady upticks in value. Whereas Bitcoin has experienced large price swings, especially between September 2020 and June 2022. During that same timeframe, both Gold and Silver remained relatively flat. From a stability standpoint, Gold and Silver are far more stable and less volatile.

When Bitcoin's Initial Uptick Began, Did It Take Away from Gold and Silver?

-If you look at Bitcoin from June 2019 to September 2020, you can see an uptick in trading volume, even though the price was generally flat during that time. However, beginning in September 2020, you see a massive spike in trading price and volume, resulting in a nearly 500% gain in a 6-month timeframe. During that same period, the trading volume in both Silver and Gold did decline somewhat from normal levels, but the price still remained within a non-volatile trading range. It appears that Bitcoin's rise in trading volume may have affected the overall trading volume of Gold and Silver, but not necessarily the value of either asset.

Which Countries Hold the Most Reserves of Gold?

-Looking at the heatmap, it's evident that the U.S. holds the most Gold reserves, followed by Russia and China. By hovering over the map, you can see that the U.S. holds approximately three times as much Gold as its closest competitor.

Data Analysis

-We will visualize and analyze the data by creating various plots and charts, such as bar charts and line graphs, to provide insights into the performance and stability of Gold, Silver, and Bitcoin over time.

Additional Analysis

In addition to comparing price and performance metrics, we will create a heatmap showing the distribution of Bitcoin, Gold, and Silver ownership by country or region. This will help us understand the global adoption and usage of these assets.

-Our analysis will culminate in a comprehensive report that will shed light on the potential of Bitcoin as a future currency and its capacity to replace traditional assets like Gold and Silver.
