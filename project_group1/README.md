# Is-Crypto-The-Future
Repo for project 3. 

The goal of this project is to compare the historical data of Bitcoin, Gold, and Silver based off of monthly price and volume data.
We will build an interactive dashboard that will display bar and line graphs for each time period that is selected.

Questions:
    1. Which asset is more stable. Gold, Silver or Bitcoin?
    2. When Bitcoins initial uptick began, did it take away from Gold and Silver?
    3. Can Bitcoin replace Gold/Silver?
    4. Which asset class is more volitile?
    5. Which countries own bitcoin and how much?

Datasets/API's
    - All historical price data is gathered using OpenBB's API
    - (Where we got bitcoin ownership by country data here)
