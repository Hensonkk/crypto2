Create the postgreSQL database. 
1. Go to postgreSQL and create a database. Name the database "Currency_db".

2. Once the database is created. Go to the public schema. Inside this schema. You will import the the file "Currency_db.sql" to your postgres
and run all the code to create the "Bitcoin, Gold & Silver" tables.

3. Once the tables are created. Go to your tables inside the public schema and import the data for each table (Bitcoin, Gold & Silver). The csv files can be 
found in the "Data" folder and find the 'currency_csvs" folder. These are the csv files that you will need to use to import the data into your SQL tables. 

4. Once the data is imported into the table. You will need to go to the app.py file and make sure your postgres username and password is set correctly for each
"@app.route" that refers to the Bitcoin, Gold & Silver tables using the postgres database. 

5. Finally, once all that is complete. Open your terminal and run 'pyhton app.py'. Should run on http://127.0.0.1:5000.
